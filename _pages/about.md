Hi! I'm Simon, a PhD student in Machine Learning at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/ml/). I'm very happy to announce that I got admitted to the [ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/)ðŸŽ†.

My background
======
I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [UAS WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt](https://fiw.thws.de/) where I stumbled across Machine Learning. From this point on, I worked as student research assistant in this field and published my [Bachelor thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9892153) at IJCNN'22. I quickly realized that a deeper understanding of mathematics is necessary to survive in AI-research. So, I pursued a Master's in Data Science at [FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.math-datascience.nat.fau.de/) with a final thesis project at the [Pervasive AI Lab @ Uni Pisa](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) in the field of graph neural networks.
