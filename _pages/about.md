Hi! I'm Simon, a final year master student in Data Science at [FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de/).

My background
======
I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [UAS Würzburg-Schweinfurt](https://fiw.thws.de/) where I stumbled across machine learning. From this point on, I worked as student research assistant in this field and published my Bachelor thesis at IJCNN'21. 
During a short stay in Bamberg's M.Sc. Applied Computer Science study, I realized quickly that deeper understanding of mathematics is necessary to survive in AI-research. Now, I'm close to finish my master studies in Erlangen at the data science department and planning my next steps to find a good PhD topic.
