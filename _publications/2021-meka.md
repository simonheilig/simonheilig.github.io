In this paper, we explored the memory efficient approximation of kernel matrices that lead to invalid kernels. We proposed to correct the eigenspectrum with a shift computed via the Lanczos-Iteration. This correction leads to stable downstream tasks and despite having a large approximation error, competitive scores on the tasks.
