In this talk I will present current challenges in graph neural networks (GNN), namely the two well-known problems of over-squashing and over-smoothing the representations. After gaining intuition about the problems, I will present ideas from literature how to overcome these issues. This talk ends by providing the current ideas for my master thesis, namely incorporating the concept of Hamiltonian dynamics.
