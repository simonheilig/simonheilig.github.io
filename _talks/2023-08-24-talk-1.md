In the last years, graph neural networks (GNN) have gained a lot of attraction in research. Thanks to their ability to embed graph structures, numerous downstream tasks can now be successfully addressed at the level of nodes, edges, and graphs. 
Despite their success, increasing the number of layers to capture long-term dependencies leads to over-squashing and over-smoothing of feature representations. After gaining intuition about why and where the problems occur, this talk focuses on strategies to overcome over-squashing. Inspired by the formulation of deep neural architectures as stable and non-dissaptive ODEs, long-term dependencies in the information flow can be preserved. Finally, an outlook on a different formulation in terms of Hamiltonian dynamics is given.
